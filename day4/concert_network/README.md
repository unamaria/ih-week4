# CONCERTS FINDER

Create an application to help our users find interesting concerts.

# Iteration 1
We need to be able to create new concerts and view a concert details.
Each concert has a band, a venue, a city, a date, a price and a description.

# Iteration 2
In the front page we need to see what is happening today and a list called "later this month" with all the concerts later this month.

# Iteration 3
Each concert can be commented so visitors can say something about the concert.

# Iteration 4
Create a page where the user can say how much is she willing to spend and show her a list with all future concerts for that amount or less. 

# Iteration 5
Add a page called most popular concerts where you can see the 10 most commented concerts ordered by number of comments.
